*Axis* Controller
===========================================

|

*Axis* is a high-end single motor pulse generator /controller for linear system applications 
with stepper motors or compatible step/dir/enable controlled servor motors.

Features:

**Common Step, Dir, Enable, 5V, Fault interface.**

**High step rate**

   * Up to 75KHz

**Microstepping** / **Pitch** / **Backlash**:

   * Configurable steps/rev and units/rev for accurate translation of rotational to linear motion.
   * Backlash support with configurable backlash compensation speed (current or maximum)

**Controls** / **Jogging**:

   * Continuous movement, after long press of **A-** / **A+**
   * Controlled movement, while **B-** / **B+** are pressed
   * Step Mode: cycle through predefined step sizes with **UP**/**DOWN**

**Speed control** 

   * Adjustable Speed/Rpm via potentiometer (even when in motion). Maximum speed is configurable.

**Limit switch support**

   * Supports plain mechanical switches or active proximity switches.

**Homing**

   * The limit switch can used as a *home* switch, a reference poin where the position is zeroed out and motion is then restricted within the bounds of software (virtual) limits.

**Bouncing modes**

   * Reverses the motor on triggering a hardware limit (limit switch) or a software limit (when axis is homed), on Forward, Backward or both directions.  

**Units**

   * *Metric* or *Imperial* which can be changed on the fly.

**Configurable pin directions (Step, Dir, Enable, Limit)**

**Wide power supply input support 9 to 27 VDC**
