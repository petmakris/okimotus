*Axis* Controller
===========================================

|

*Axis* is a high-end, single motor, jog controller for motors controller by a step/dir interface. 
The user interface allows for easy control of the motor's position, 
with a single knob for speed control and buttons for controlling direction and step size and much more.

There three modes of operation available:

- Degrees (Angular): Tracks the position in degrees, with a configurable number of steps per revolution.

- Millimeters (Linear/Metric): Tracks the position in millimeters, with a configurable number of steps per millimeter by specifying the pitch of the leadscrew/ballscrew the motor attaches to in millimeters.

- Inches (Linear/Imperial): Tracks the position in inches, with a configurable number of steps per inch.

Features:

**Common Step, Dir, Enable, 5V, Fault interface.**

**High step rate**

   * Up to 75KHz

**Microstepping** / **Pitch** / **Backlash**:

   * Configurable steps/rev and units/rev for accurate translation of rotational to linear motion.
   * Backlash support with configurable backlash compensation speed (current or maximum)

**Controls** / **Jogging**:

   * Continuous movement, after long press of **A-** / **A+**
   * Controlled movement, while **B-** / **B+** are pressed
   * Step Mode: cycle through predefined step sizes with **UP**/**DOWN**

**Speed control** 

   * Adjustable Speed/Rpm via potentiometer (even when in motion). Maximum speed is configurable.

**Limit switch support**

   * Supports plain mechanical switches or active proximity switches.

**Homing**

   * The limit switch can used as a *home* switch, a reference poin where the position is zeroed out and motion is then restricted within the bounds of software (virtual) limits.

**Bouncing modes**

   * Reverses the motor on triggering a hardware limit (limit switch) or a software limit (when axis is homed), on Forward, Backward or both directions.  

**Units**

   * *Metric* or *Imperial* which can be changed on the fly.

**Configurable pin directions (Step, Dir, Enable, Limit)**

**Wide power supply input support 9 to 27 VDC**
