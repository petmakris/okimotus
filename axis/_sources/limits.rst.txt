Axis will freely rotate the motor when the home position is unknown (homing sequence not yet performed)
until it reaches a limit switch where it will either stop or reverse depending on the ``Bounce`` setting.

If ``Bounce`` is ``Forward`` or ``Both`` and the motor is moving in the forward direction
then the motor will reverse when the limit switch is triggered (position ``B``). The motor will overshoot
by an amount ``ΔL+`` which depends on the current motor velocity and acceleration. 
If ``Bounce`` is not enabled for the forward direction then the motor will just 
stop when the limit switch is triggered (position ``B``).

If ``Bounce`` is ``Backward`` or ``Both`` and the motor is moving in the backward direction
then the motor will reverse if the limit switch is triggered (position ``A``). The motor will overshoot
by an amount ``ΔL-`` which depends on the current motor velocity and acceleration.
If ``Bounce`` is not enabled for the backward direction then the motor will just 
stop when the limit switch is triggered (position ``A``).

E.g. If two limit switches are connected in parallel and `Bounce` is ``Both``, 
if a continuous motion is started by long pressing ``A-`` or ``A+`` then the motor will continuously move between
the two limit switches.

Movement with home position known 
-------------------------------------------------

If the home position is known (succesful homing sequence performed) then the motor is
allowed to move between `zero` and :ref:`Position Max`. 

In this case there is no undershoot as the motor should stop before triggering the limit switch 
(if the limit switch is triggered while the motor moved between `zero` and :ref:`Position Max` then
