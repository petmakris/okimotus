Axis will freely rotate the motor when the home position is unknown (homing sequence not yet performed)
until it reaches a limit switch where it will either stop or reverse depending on the ``Bounce`` setting.

If ``Bounce`` is ``Forward`` or ``Both`` and the motor is moving in the forward direction
then the motor will reverse when the limit switch is triggered (position ``B``). The motor will overshoot
by an amount ``ΔL+`` which depends on the current motor velocity and acceleration. 
If ``Bounce`` is not enabled for the forward direction then the motor will just 
stop when the limit switch is triggered (position ``B``).

If ``Bounce`` is ``Backward`` or ``Both`` and the motor is moving in the backward direction
then the motor will reverse if the limit switch is triggered (position ``A``). The motor will overshoot
by an amount ``ΔL-`` which depends on the current motor velocity and acceleration.
If ``Bounce`` is not enabled for the backward direction then the motor will just 
stop when the limit switch is triggered (position ``A``).

E.g. If two limit switches are connected in parallel and `Bounce` is ``Both``, 
if a continuous motion is started by long pressing ``A-`` or ``A+`` then the motor will continuously move between
the two limit switches.

Movement with home position known 
-------------------------------------------------

If the home position is known (successful homing sequence performed) then the motor is
allowed to move between `zero` (position ``X0``) and :ref:`Position Max` (position ``Xm``). 
The allowed range of motion is denoted in the next figure as ``Sm``. 

In the ``Sm`` range there must be no trigger from any limit switch. 
If the limit switch is triggered while the motor moves between ``X0`` and ``Xm`` then axis will 
halt and indicate an error has occurred (the display will show `Status 101`).

Sometimes we want the home position to be at some specific distance from the limit switch
and is denoted by the symbol ``Sb`` in the next figure. The distance ``Sb`` is called 
the `Backoff distance` and configurable via the :ref:`Backoff Distance` parameter.
